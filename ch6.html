         This section explains how to resolve and prevent incidents. A customer service analyst must resolve incidents quickly and efficiently. To do this, he follows the incident management process. This process helps to restore service quickly to minimize the impact of the incident. When an incident cannot be resolved immediately, someone must be held accountable. This ensures efficient follow-up. After resolution, all information must be recorded to analyze trends.Problem management helps to identify and prevent future incidents, thereby improving business operations.
